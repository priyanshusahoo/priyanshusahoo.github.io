    <p> Lets get a proper knowledge about what a <em>"programming language"</em> is and why it has become so popular in recent years,and we will discuss about the <b>requirement</b> about the <b>programming languages</b>, the types and most popular programming languages.</p>

     <h2 id="y"> What is a programmimg language?</h2><br>
     <p id="x">A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various <br>kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.<br> Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.Thousands of different programming<br> languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are<br> written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the<br> declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).

The description of a<br> programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).<br> Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is <br>specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that<br> is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and <br>extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</p><br>

            <p id="t">Programming Language- it is vocabulary and a collection of rules that command a computer, devices,<br> applications to work according to the written codes. The programing language enables us to write efficient<br> programs and develop online solutions such as- mobile applications, web applications, and games, etc.<br>

Programming is used to automate, maintain, assemble, measure and interpret the processing of the data<br> and information. It helps in accelerating the input and output of the devices or applications.</p>

            <p id="t">Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through <br>the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data.There <br>are several tools and platforms, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, available that can be used to develop the front<br> end of a website, and understanding which tools are best fit for specific tasks marks the difference<br> between developing a hacked site and a well designed, scalable site.</p>

            <p id="p">Back end Development refers to the server side of development where you are primarily<br> focused on how the site works. Making updates and changes in addition to monitoring<br> functionality of the site will be your primary responsibility. This type of web development<br> usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Code written by<br> back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser.<br> Anything you can’t see easily with the eye such as databases and servers is the work<br> of a back end developer.  Back end developer positions are often called programmers<br> or web developers.Many back end developers know front end languages such as HTML<br> and CSS but need to use languages such as Java, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python, and<br> .Net to get the back end job done.  Back end developers are most focused on a site’s <br>responsiveness and speed</p>

            <p id="t">DBMS is a complex piece of software, and it consists of many components. But there’s one component<br> I’d like to mention right away, since it’s so important to the subject of this book, and that’s the optimizer. <br>The optimizer is the DBMS component that’s responsible for deciding exactly how to implement user requests.<br> The point is this: Most requests (indeed, very likely all requests) are capable of being implemented in a<br> variety—typically a very large variety—of different ways. Moreover, those different ways will typically have widely<br> differing performance characteristics; in particular, they could have execution times that vary, quite literally, from fractions<br> of a second to many days. Thus, it’s very important that the optimizer choose a “good” way to implement any given request, <br>where “good” essentially means having good performance.Structured Query Language (mysql) is a domain-specific language <br>used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS),<br> or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).</p>
